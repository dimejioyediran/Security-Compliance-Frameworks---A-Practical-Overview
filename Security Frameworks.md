# Security Compliance & Frameworks ‚Äì A Practical Overview

Security compliance is the practice of ensuring that an organization‚Äôs operations, policies, and systems meet established legal, regulatory, and industry security standards.  
It is not just a ‚Äúbox-ticking‚Äù exercise ‚Äî it is about building trust, reducing risk, and ensuring that security measures align with business objectives.

## üìå Why Security Compliance Matters
Security compliance is essential for:
- **Protecting sensitive data** from breaches and misuse.
- **Meeting legal obligations** to avoid fines and penalties.
- **Maintaining trust** with customers, partners, and regulators.
- **Improving cybersecurity posture** through structured frameworks.

Think of **cybersecurity** as ‚Äúprotecting‚Äù and **compliance** as ‚Äúproving protection.‚Äù

## üõ° The Relationship Between Security Compliance & Cybersecurity
- **Cybersecurity** is proactive ‚Äî implementing controls to prevent, detect, and respond to threats.
- **Compliance** is reactive and evidence-driven ‚Äî proving through audits, documentation, and reports that controls are effective and meet standards.

Good cybersecurity without compliance may fail in audits.  
Compliance without real cybersecurity can leave organizations vulnerable.
