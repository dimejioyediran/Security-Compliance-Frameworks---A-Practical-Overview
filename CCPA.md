# Understanding the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA)

## Introduction
The **California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA)** is one of the most significant privacy laws in the United States. Enacted in **2018** and effective from **January 1, 2020**, the CCPA gives California residents greater control over how their personal data is collected, used, and shared by businesses.  

Although it is a **state-level law**, its impact extends far beyond California because many companies that operate nationally or globally must comply if they process data from California residents.  

The CCPA is often compared to the **EU‚Äôs General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)**, but it has unique features and applies specifically to businesses serving California residents.

## Objectives of CCPA
The CCPA aims to:
- Enhance privacy rights for California residents.  
- Increase transparency in how businesses collect and use consumer data.  
- Provide consumers with control over their personal information.  
- Hold businesses accountable for the misuse or mishandling of data.

## Who Does the CCPA Apply To?
The CCPA applies to **for-profit businesses** that meet **any** of the following criteria:

1. **Annual Gross Revenue** exceeds **$25 million**.  
2. **Data Transactions**: Buy, receive, or sell the personal information of **50,000 or more** consumers, households, or devices annually.  
3. **Revenue from Data Sales**: Earn **50% or more** of their annual revenue from selling consumer data.  

This means not all businesses are covered, but many **tech companies, online retailers, and data-driven organizations** fall under CCPA‚Äôs scope.

## Key Consumer Rights Under CCPA
The CCPA grants California residents several rights regarding their personal data:

1. **Right to Know**  
   Consumers can request details on what personal data a business collects, how it is used, and with whom it is shared.  

2. **Right to Delete**  
   Consumers can ask businesses to delete their personal data, with some exceptions (e.g., legal obligations).  

3. **Right to Opt-Out of Sale**  
   Consumers can direct businesses not to sell their personal data. Companies must provide a clear **‚ÄúDo Not Sell My Personal Information‚Äù** link on their websites.  

4. **Right to Non-Discrimination**  
   Consumers cannot be discriminated against for exercising their privacy rights, such as being denied services or charged higher prices.  

5. **Right to Data Access (Portability)**  
   Consumers can request a copy of their personal data in a portable and usable format.

## CCPA vs GDPR

|---------------------|-----------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| Scope               | California residents                         | EU residents                            |
| Personal Data       | Broad, includes household data                | Broad, includes sensitive categories     |
| Legal Basis         | Focus on consumer rights and opt-outs         | Requires lawful basis for processing     |
| Fines               | Up to $7,500 per violation                   | Up to ‚Ç¨20 million or 4% global revenue   |
